Learn how to use OpenCV for Computer Vision and AI in [this](https://opencv.org/opencv-free-course/) full course for beginners. You will learn and get exposed to a wide range of exciting topics like Image & Video Manipulation, Image Enhancement, Filtering, Edge Detection, Object Detection and Tracking, Face Detection and the OpenCV Deep Learning Module.

But, I replaced the use of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install) with a simple script running stand alone.
