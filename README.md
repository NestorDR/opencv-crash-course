# [OpenCV Crash Course](https://opencv.org/opencv-free-course/)
Learn how to use OpenCV for Computer Vision and AI in [this](https://opencv.org/opencv-free-course/) full course for beginners. You will learn and get exposed to a wide range of exciting topics like Image & Video Manipulation, Image Enhancement, Filtering, Edge Detection, Object Detection and Tracking, Face Detection and the OpenCV Deep Learning Module.

I'm taking the course, but replaced using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install) with a simple script that runs stand alone. 

## Development platform
Python 3.10.4 on Microsoft Windows 11
